3D Vision Security in Robot Operation Area

Combining 3D vision, character detection, and spatial recognition technologies, unlike traditional camera security monitoring systems, it can calculate the three-dimensional spatial coordinates of target objects and accurately determine whether an object has entered a dangerous area; In addition, it is not affected by environmental lighting conditions and can be monitored normally even in low light environments. The 3D visual security of robot operation areas can provide more accurate and comprehensive monitoring information. Compared with traditional 2D monitoring, 3D monitoring can obtain the three-dimensional shape and position information of objects, thereby more accurately determining their attributes, behaviors, and intentions. This high-precision and all-round monitoring capability can effectively improve the accuracy and reliability of security monitoring, reducing false alarms and omissions. Secondly, 3D visual security in robot operation areas can improve the efficiency and response speed of security monitoring. By automatically identifying abnormal behavior and threats, the system can issue timely alerts and automatically track targets, greatly reducing the time from discovering anomalies to taking action. This can not only improve the efficiency of security prevention, but also provide more timely support for emergency response.
